- Database Normalization #1 - 1NF

The following unnormalized table named PRODUCT is transformed to first normal form (1NF) 
by splitting it into two tables which have X and Y rows (such that X <Y) respectively. 
Both the tables have Z columns.

*Product-ID*    *Colors*    *Price*
1               Red,Green   15.0
2               Blue        18.0
3               Yellow,Pink 2.5
What are the values of X, Y, Z?

=> 3,5,2

3 prices, 5 colors, 2 columns(product-id, colors/price)


- Database Normalization #2 - 1/2/3 NF

A particular database is normalized to satisfy a particular level of normalization (either 1NF or 2NF or 3NF). 
One of the tables contains, among other fields, a column for the City and a column for the Zip Code.
Assuming that there is a many-to-one mapping between the set of Zip Code(s) and City, 
we may conclude that the database is definitely NOT in NF form. 
What is the integer x (1, 2, or 3)? Fill your answer in the text box below.

=> 3


- Database Normalization #3

A database used by a college’s application stores the relationship between students and the courses they are enrolled in. 
We have information for each STUDENT (such as name, date of birth, date of enrollment, student-id) and COURSE (course code, instructor, etc.). In real life, a student takes several courses simultaneously while a subject is studied by several students. 
We need to capture this many-to-many relationship in our database. From the above information, 
what is the minimum number of tables required to structure this database in accordance with the rules of 2NF normalization?

=> 3

student table, course table, and enrollment table


- Database Normalization #4

A database, normalized as per 2NF rules, has been split into 10 tables. 
Each of the tables has exactly two columns: one key attribute and one non-key attribute. 
What is the minimum number of tables required to express this database in 3NF form? 

=> 10


- Database Normalization #5

Consider the following relation and determinants.

R(a, b,c,d)

                   a,c -> b,d
                   a,d -> b
        Also, a,b is a primary key for the above relation.
		
The above relation is in x NF form where x may take the following values {1,2,3,3.5} corresponding to {1NF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF} respectively.
What is the maximum possible value of x such that the above relation satisfies the *x*NF form?

=> 3


- Database Normalization #6

Let us take the example of a simple movie library. Each movie has a description, director, and serial number. 
Customers have a name, address, and membership number. Assume only one copy of each movie exists in the library. 
We are given the following relations and determinants. The keys for each relation are CAPITALIZED.

Relations (The key is CAPITALIZED):
customer(name,addr,MEMBERNO)
movie(DESCRIPTION,director,serialno)
borrow(memberno,DATE,SERIALNO)

Determinants:
description->director,serialno
serialno->description
serialno->director
name,addr -> memberno
memberno -> name,addr
serialno,date -> memberno
The above relation is in x**NF form where x may take the following values {1,2,3,3.5} corresponding to {1NF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF} respectively.
What is the maximum possible value of **x such that the above relation satisfies the *x*NF form?

=> 2

In movie column, director depends on serialno, and serialno depends on description (Transitive dependence - unaccepted for 3NF)


- Database Normalization #7
Let us take the example of a simple movie library. Each movie has a description, director, and serial number. 
Customers have a name, address, and membership number. Assume only one copy of each movie exists in the library. 
We are given the following relations and determinants:

Relations:
movie(DESCRIPTION,serialno)
serial(SERIALNO,director)
customer(name,addr,MEMBERNO)
borrow(memberno,DATE,SERIALNO)

Determinants:
description->director,serialno
serialno->description
serialno->director
name,addr -> memberno
memberno -> name,addr
serialno,date -> memberno
The above relation is in x**NF form where x may take the following values {1,2,3,3.5} corresponding to {1NF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF} respectively.
What is the maximum possible value of **x such that the above relation satisfies the *x*NF form?

=> 3.5


- Database Normalization #8

Let us take the example of a simple movie library. Each movie has a description, director, and serial number. 
Customers have a name, address, and membership number. Assume only one copy of each movie exists in the library.
We are given the following relations and determinants. The keys for each relation are CAPITALIZED.

Relations (The key is CAPITALIZED):
customer(name,addr,MEMBERNO)
movie(DESCRIPTION,director,serialno)
borrow(memberno,DATE,SERIALNO)
Which of these determinants is a NON-KEY dependency? In the text box, only enter the index number (1-6) of the dependency which you have identified as non-key.

1.  description->director,serialno
2.  serialno->description
3.  serialno->director
4.  name,addr -> memberno
5.  memberno -> name,addr
6.  serialno,date -> memberno

=> 3

- Database Normalization #9

Consider the following relation and determinants. The key(s) are bolded.
R(a, b ,c,d,e)

Which of these determinants is a NON-CANDIDATE key? In the text box, only enter the index number (1-3) of the dependency which you have identified as non-key.

1. a,c -> b,d,e
2. a,d -> b
3. a,c,e -> b,d

=> 2


- Database Normalization #10

The following table stores rows of information about pizza deliveries. 
The three columns correspond to the Restaurant name, Crust, Delivery Area. 
We convert this table into Fourth Normal Form and so we end up creating two tables, each with two columns and N rows. 
(Both the new tables have an equal number of rows)

Restaurant  Crust       Delivery Area
-------------------------------------------
X Pizza     Thick       Whitefield
X Pizza     Thick       Greenville
X Pizza     Thick       Capital
X Pizza     Stuffed     Whitefield
X Pizza     Stuffed     Greenville
X Pizza     Stuffed     Capital
Papa Pizza  Thin        Capital
