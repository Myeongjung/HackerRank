- Database Normalization #1 - 1NF

The following unnormalized table named PRODUCT is transformed to first normal form (1NF) 
by splitting it into two tables which have X and Y rows (such that X <Y) respectively. 
Both the tables have Z columns.

*Product-ID*    *Colors*    *Price*
1               Red,Green   15.0
2               Blue        18.0
3               Yellow,Pink 2.5
What are the values of X, Y, Z?

=> 3,5,2

3 prices, 5 colors, 2 columns(product-id, colors/price)


- Database Normalization #2 - 1/2/3 NF

A particular database is normalized to satisfy a particular level of normalization (either 1NF or 2NF or 3NF). 
One of the tables contains, among other fields, a column for the City and a column for the Zip Code.
Assuming that there is a many-to-one mapping between the set of Zip Code(s) and City, 
we may conclude that the database is definitely NOT in NF form. 
What is the integer x (1, 2, or 3)? Fill your answer in the text box below.

=> 3


- Database Normalization #3

A database used by a college’s application stores the relationship between students and the courses they are enrolled in. 
We have information for each STUDENT (such as name, date of birth, date of enrollment, student-id) and COURSE (course code, instructor, etc.). In real life, a student takes several courses simultaneously while a subject is studied by several students. 
We need to capture this many-to-many relationship in our database. From the above information, 
what is the minimum number of tables required to structure this database in accordance with the rules of 2NF normalization?

=> 3

student table, course table, and enrollment table


- Database Normalization #4

A database, normalized as per 2NF rules, has been split into 10 tables. 
Each of the tables has exactly two columns: one key attribute and one non-key attribute. 
What is the minimum number of tables required to express this database in 3NF form? 

=> 10
